### Status Update 1 - 16/07/20

I have finished coding the main functionality of my quiz application. It is still only using dummy questions to check that it's working as expected whenever I run it to test something but it is working! So currently the user can select a quiz topic (they're all the same questions right now) and input their name. The app then randomizes the questions that the app will ask during the quiz before asking if the user is ready to start. After each question, there is a little review (basically just shows the right answer and the user's answer) and it displays a few stats: points for the question, total score up to that point, how quickly the question was answered and status of their answer streak. Still have one more feature to implement, need to get actual questions and do a little bit of cosmetic work but other than that it's looking good.
