### Status Update 1 - 16/07/20

I have finished coding the main functionality of my quiz application. It is still only using dummy questions to check that it's working as expected whenever I run it to test something but it is working! So currently the user can select a quiz topic (they're all the same questions right now) and input their name. The app then randomizes the questions that the app will ask during the quiz before asking if the user is ready to start. After each question, there is a little review (basically just shows the right answer and the user's answer) and it displays a few stats: points for the question, total score up to that point, how quickly the question was answered and status of their answer streak. Still have one more feature to implement, need to get actual questions and do a little bit of cosmetic work but other than that it's looking good.

### Status Update 2 - 17/07/20

My application is now complete! Well like 95% complete, all that's left to do is code in --help showing the read me documentation and adding in at least 1 set of actual questions rather than just the dummy questions I have at the moment that helps me check that it's working correctly. Ended up taking longer than expected to reach this point but that's mostly due to trying to work out how to implement the stuff that we learnt about this morning into my application. I managed to come up with something for it at least and it's mostly implemented, just the --help stuff like I mentioned. Coding the leaderboard feature, which is what I expected to be the most difficult, ended up not being that difficult once I looked up how to do certain things that we haven't covered yet in the course. Aside from the few things left to do with the actual application, it's now mainly writing up all the remaining documentation which hopefully won't take too long as I have a much better idea of what to write about.
